# Short.ly
Uri encoding application
This application is a java application written in spring boot framework that works as a URI encoding application.
There are 2 methods in here.
1 post request that takes in the long uri and encodes it into a new shortened format.
2 get request that redirects the short link to the original url.

Feel free to check it out and use it as it is.
